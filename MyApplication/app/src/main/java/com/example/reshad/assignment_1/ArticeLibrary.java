And MD was up there with VR. The aroma/taste reminded me of slow drip coffee from single origin coffee beans blended perfect with maple syrup. The body was perfect as it had a fuller month feel than a Kbs but not as full as a VR. \n"

Kind of surprising given how strong of a coffee flavor their double shot has. The taste is more than expected. Definite maple, coffee, sweet and sticky. Nice think velvet body, but Sioux being syrupy. Without a doubt one of best 3 beers I've had the pleasure of trying.\n"

Although a very high abv it does not taste alcohol forward and is truly balanced with a good amount of hops on your tongue, a bit of grapefruit follow through and a floral scent. Had a great time drying off and warming up and 3 10oz pours along with some Elder and Blind Pig hit the spot. It is a special beer worth the effort.\n"

The flavor was initially overwhelming sharp hop bitterness. This faded to a pleasant biscuity malt flavor. Medium high carbonation was almost prickly on the tongue, but helped round out the mouthfeel of a beer that could have otherwise been a touch heavy. Instead, it is an easy drinking beer that finishes clean and sweet, but short of sticky sweet, and with a hint of the citrus and spice of the hops. Overall, it is a fantastic IPA.\n"

I only tried the lower alcohol version of this one, as there are other better Swedish beers to get in higher alcohol. Average in all ways, not really good but not bad either. Smells a bit of corn, all in all nothing special. Nevertheless I liked this beer and it served me well. I was still able to drink much with my friends, when I had a sore throat! It was very smooth in all ways. Take it for what it is and enjoy. Just a typical beer to drink and have a good time. \n"
